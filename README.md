The Worst Fit Algorithm is a memory allocation strategy used to allocate memory blocks to processes (or jobs). It is designed to assign a process to the largest available memory block that can accommodate it. This approach leaves the largest leftover space, which may help reduce external fragmentation for future allocations.
How the Worst Fit Algorithm Works
Initialization:

Memory blocks and jobs are prepared.
Each memory block has a size, and jobs have specific memory requirements.
For Each Job:

Traverse all the memory blocks.
Find the largest free memory block that can fit the job's memory requirement.
If no suitable block is found, the job is not allocated.
Allocation:

Assign the job to the identified largest memory block.
Reduce the block's size by the memory allocated to the job.
If the block's remaining size becomes 0, mark it as unavailable.
Output:

Display the allocation results, showing which memory block each job is assigned to (if any).
Display the remaining size and status of each memory block after all allocations.
